My Contributions:

-> Integrated the OpenAI API into the Flask backend, handling request formatting, API authentication, and error handling.
-> Implemented task-based triggers that automatically generate and send reminder emails when items become overdue.
-> Engineered efficient prompt templates to ensure context-aware, personalized messages for different user scenarios.
-> Managed parsing and clean formatting of JSON API responses for email output.
-> Worked with teammates to link AI-generated email text to the app’s existing task database and user account system.
-> Debugged backend workflow issues and ensured seamless connection between the AI system and user interface.
